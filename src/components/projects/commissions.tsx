        The management was carried out using the <em>SCRUM</em> framework. Every
        day, 10 to 15-minute meetings were held to update the team on progress
        and address any questions. At the end of each iteration, we had remote
        meetings with the end user. The tools used were <em>Trello</em> for
        project management and <em>Git</em> for version control of the
        application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The backend was developed using <em>ASP .NET MVC</em> and{" "}
        <em>SQL Server</em> for data management, while the frontend used{" "}
        <em>Bootstrap 3</em>
        and <em>jQuery</em>.
      </p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        In the final delivery, all requirements were met, a user manual was
        created, and the end users were trained.
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The initiative is key for professional development and the project's
        success; it was a challenge to communicate this to each team member.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear and concise communication with appropriate language is very
        important for the team to feel motivated and valued.
