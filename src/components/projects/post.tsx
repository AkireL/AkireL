      <h2>POS</h2>
      <p>Developing a desktop software for POS.</p>

      <h2>Roles</h2>
      <p>
        Responsibilities included: Business analysis, Scrum Master, and
        Technical Lead.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution</h2>

      <p>
        In the analysis and design stages, I defined the implementation based on
        a multi-tier architecture, including the database structure and the user
        interface design. I worked collaboratively with another team member to
        create wireframes which were presented to the project stakeholder for
        review. Any necessary revisions were made and the final wireframes were
        then provided to the development team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was responsible for guiding the project's progress through the
        development phase, employing the SCRUM methodology. To support the team,
        I provided technical assistance and used tools such as Trello to
        organize and prioritize user stories in collaboration with the product
        owner. Daily stand-ups of 10-15 minutes allowed me to address team
        questions and ensure everyone had the information required to complete
        their tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application was developed using a technology stack consisting of C#,
        WPF, and SQL Server.
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The final delivery fully satisfied all client requirements. </p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        This project taught me the importance of clear and concise
        communication, as well as the ability to work effectively as a team,
        especially when dealing with change. The experience of collaborating
        with both in-person and remote team members was particularly insightful.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was a great opportunity to implement and practice what I
        learned about Scrum.
