        This project was a prototype for managing and selling travel packages to
        the general public through company collaborators or sales
        representatives.

      <h2>Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        As a web developer, I contributed to the frontend of the project,
        implementing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 3. I also participated in backend
        development, coding search queries using SQL Server and ASP.NET MVC 5.
      </p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>All requirements were met in the final delivery. </p>

      <h2>Challenges and acquired knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        While working on this project, I expanded my knowledge of CSS, focusing
        on media queries and Bootstrap 3. Additionally, I learned to leverage
        the ASP .NET MVC framework, LINQ, and SQL Server for backend
        development.
