        Development of a CRM adapted to the operations of the sales department.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>In the final delivery, all requirements were met.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The learning of a new technology during development with limited time
        was a primary challenge, as the situation involved constant changes in
        business logic. Once I became familiar with the new technology, I was
        able to recover the time spent on learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communication, cooperation, and the interest of the end client are
        undoubtedly vital for development.
