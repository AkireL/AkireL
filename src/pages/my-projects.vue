                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Users often face significant complexity and
                compatibility issues when building custom PCs, leading to suboptimal choices,
                frustrating experiences, and potential returns. <br /><br />
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Architected and developed an intelligent, AI-powered
                recommendation system (PHP, Laravel, LLM, Microservices, Threads, MySQL). This
                system dynamically generates personalized and fully compatible PC builds,
                simplifying technical choices and making advanced technology accessible to a broader
                audience.

                <strong>Challenge:</strong> The team faced an unsustainable backlog of manual review
                approvals, causing delays in publishing product reviews. <br /><br />
                <strong>Solution:</strong> I developed an automated solution leveraging an LLM to
                intelligently classify reviews. This system eliminated the team's operational
                burden, allowing them to focus on strategic work. <br /><br />
                <strong>Impact:</strong> Product reviews were finally published, significantly
                improving user trust and engagement, while freeing up team resources for
                higher-value tasks.
